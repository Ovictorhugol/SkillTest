# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was made with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

But if you want to access the build version you can go to [https://skillteste.netlify.app/](https://skillteste.netlify.app/)
